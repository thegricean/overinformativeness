### Add information on costs

## 1) Add frequencies from Google Books corpus and compute log frequency diffs for regression

frequencies = read.table(file="../data/raw/cost_exp3/exp3_frequency.csv",sep=",", header=T, quote="")
frequencies$noun = as.factor(tolower(as.character(frequencies$noun))) # make labels uniform

frequencies = frequencies %>%
  select(noun, relFreq)

## 2) Empirical lengths

# Read manual coding of speaker utterances:
lengths_extended = read.table(file="../data/raw/cost_exp3/exp3_length_manual_compilation.csv",sep=",", header=T, quote="")
lengths_extended$noun = as.factor(tolower(as.character(lengths_extended$noun))) # make labels uniform

# (lengths_extended is a semi-manually created file that compiles the lengths of different instances of sub, 
# basic, and super mentions. Orgininally this should have been automatically; however, it turned out to be
# difficult to foresee which alternatives referring expressions would be uttered by participants 
# (i.e., many alternatives could not be automatically coded). 
# Thus this document lists all used speaker referring expressions used in our production experiment, 
# their length and their count, as well as the average empirical length and standard deviation.)

lengths = lengths_extended %>%
  select(noun, average_length)

write.csv(lengths, "../data/raw/cost_exp3/exp3_length_uniform_labels.csv", row.names = F, quote = F)

## 3) Combine to cost file:

costs = full_join(frequencies, lengths, by="noun")
write.csv(costs, "../data/cost_exp3.csv", row.names = F, quote = F)
