\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Reference to objects is one of the most basic and prevalent uses of language. But how do speakers choose amongst the wealth of referring expressions they have at their disposal? How does a speaker choose whether to refer to an object as \emph{the animal}, \emph{the dog}, \emph{the dalmatian}, or \emph{the big mostly white dalmatian}? The context within which the object occurs  (other non-dogs, other dogs, other dalmatians) plays a large part in determining which features the speaker chooses to include in their utterance  -- speakers aim to be sufficiently informative to uniquely establish reference to the intended object. However, speakers' utterances often exhibit what has been claimed to be \emph{overinformativeness}: referring expressions are often more specific than necessary for establishing unique reference, and they are so in systematic ways. However, providing a unified theory for speakers' systematic patterns of overinformativeness has so far proved elusive.

This paper is concerned with  modeling precisely this choice of referring expression (RE). We restrict ourselves to definite descriptions of the form \emph{the (ADJ}?\emph{)}+ \emph{NOUN}, that is, noun phrases that minimally contain the definite determiner \emph{the} followed by a head noun. In addition, any number of adjectives can occur between the determiner and the noun.\footnote{In contrast, we will \emph{not} provide a treatment of pronominal referring expressions, indefinite descriptions, names, or definite descriptions with post-nominal modification, though we offer some speculative remarks on how the approach outlined here can be applied to these cases. \jd{make sure you actually do this.}} A model of these REs will allow us to unify two domains in language production that have been typically treated as separate, and that have typically been treated as interesting for different reasons: the production of so-called overmodified referring expressions on the one hand, which a lot of literature in language production has been devoted to \cite{bla blabla}; and the production of simple nominal expressions, which has so far mostly received attention in the concepts and categorization literature \cite{bla bla}. In the following, we review some of the key phenomena and puzzles in each of these literatures which have for the most part been treated as unrelated. We then present a model of RE production within the Rational Speech Acts \cite{frank2012} framework, which treats speakers as boundedly rational agents that try to optimize the tradeoff between utterance cost and  informativeness. Our key innovation is to relax the assumption that semantic truth functions are deterministic. \jd{one sentence here that inspires intuition} It is this crucial innovation that allows us to provide a unified explanation for a great number of seemingly disparate phenomena from the modified and nominal RE literature.

\subsection{Production of referring expressions: a case against rational language use?}

How should a cooperative speaker produce referring expressions? Grice, in his seminal work, provided some guidance by formulating his famous conversational maxims, intended as a guide to listeners' expectations about good speaker behavior \citeNP{grice1975}. His maxim of Quantity, consisting of two parts, requires of speakers to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{Quantity-1:} Make your contribution as informative as s required (for the purposes of the exchange).
	\item \emph{Quantity-2:} Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.
\end{enumerate}

That is, speakers should aim to produce neither under- nor overinformative utterances. While much support has been found for the former \cite{lots of people}, speakers seem remarkably happy to systematically violate Quantity-2. In modified referring expressions, they routinely produce modifiers that do not uniquely establish reference (e.g., \emph{the big blue thumbtack} instead of \emph{the big thumbtack} in contexts like \figref{fig:thumbtack} \cite{bla bla}). In simple nominal expressions, speakers routinely choose to refer to an object with a basic level term even when a superordinate level term would have been sufficient for establishing reference (e.g., \emph{the dog} instead of \emph{the animal} in contexts like \figref{subfig:dogartifacts} \cite{bla bla}).

These observations have posed a challenge for rational accounts of language use (including the Gricean one): why this extra expenditure of useless effort? Why this seeming blindness to the level of informativeness requirement? Many have argued from these observations that speakers are in fact not economical \cite{bla}. Some have derived a built-in preference for referring at the basic level from considerations of \jd{bla} and \jd{bla} \cite{Rosch1976}. Others have argued for salience-driven effects on willingness to overmodify \cite{dutch guys}. In all cases, it is argued that informativeness cannot be the key factor in determining the content of speakers' referring expressions.

Here we revisit this claim and show that systematically relaxing the requirement of a deterministic semantics for referring expressions also systematically changes the informativeness of utterances, in effect leading to a reconceptualization of what have been termed \emph{overinformative referring expressions} as \emph{rationally redundant referring expressions}. We begin by reviewing the phenomena of interest that a revised theory of definite referring expressions should be able to account for. 

\subsection{Modified referring expressions}
\label{sec:modified}


\subsubsection{Asymmetry in redundant use of color and size adjectives}
\label{sec:asymmetry}

Most of the literature on overinformative referring expressions has been devoted to the use of overinformative modifiers in modified referring expressions. For example, in \figref{fig:thumbtacksize} singling out the central object requires only mentioning its size (\emph{the big thumbtack}). But it is now well-documented that speakers routinely include redundant color adjectives, which do not uniquely single out the intended referent in these kinds of contexts (\emph{the big blue thumbtack}, \cite{pechmann gatt engelhardt rubio-fernandez}). However, the same is not true for size: in contexts like \figref{fig:thumbtackcolor}, where color is sufficient for unique reference (\emph{the blue thumbtack}), speakers do not overmodify with size. \tableref{tab:colorsizeasymmetry} shows proportions of color, size, and (overinformative) color-and-size mentions in conditions like those depicted in \figref{fig:thumbtack} across different experiments. In all cases there is a preference for overmodifying with color but not with size.\footnote{There is quite a bit of variation in the actual numbers. We will discuss this variation in the General Discussion. \jd{or already in the model section where we get the basic asymmetry}}

Explanations for this asymmetry have varied from \jd{bla} to \jd{bla}. However, while these explanations may capture the asymmetry in and of itself, they do not capture the more subtle systematicity with which the preference to overmodify with color changes. We delve into these more subtle patterns in the next two sections.

\subsubsection{Scene variation}
\label{sec:scenevariation}

Speakers' propensity to overmodify with color is highly dependent on features of the distractor objects in the context. In particular, as the variation present in the scene increases, so does the probability of overmodifying with color \cite{davieskatsos, koolen2013}. How exactly scene variation is quantified differs between papers \jd{give some examples}. One very clear demonstration of the scene variation effect was given by \citeA{koolen2013}, who quantified scene variation as the number of feature dimensions along which objects in a scene vary. Over the course of three experiments, they compared a low-variation condition in which objects never differed in color with a high-variation condition in which objects differed in type, color, orientation, and size. They consistently found higher rates of overmodification with color in the high-variation (28-27\%) than in the low-variation (4-10\%) conditions.

They explain these results with reference to \jd{bla}.

\subsubsection{Feature typicality}
\label{sec:colortypicality}

Finally, overmodification with color has been shown to be systematically related to the typicality of the color for the object. Building on work by \citeA{sedivy2003a}, \citeA{westerbeek2015} (and more recently, \citeA{rubiofernandez2016}) have shown that the more typical a color is for an object, the less likely it is to be mentioned when not necessary for unique reference. For example, speakers never refer to a yellow banana as \emph{the yellow banana}, but they sometimes refer to a brown banana as \emph{the brown banana}, and they almost always refer to a blue banana as \emph{the blue banana}. In fact, color typicality and probability of color mention seem to be linearly negatively correlated \cite{westerbeek2015}. Similar typicality effects have been shown for other (non-color) properties. For example, \citeA{Mitchell2013} showed that speakers are more likely to overmodify with shape and material adjectives when referring to everyday objects like boxes, when the shape and material was atypical (e.g., heart-shaped, made of clay) than when it was typical (e.g., square, made of cardboard).

Explanations have invoked both speaker-internal salience \jd{who says what exactly?} as well as audience design \jd{who says what exactly?}.

\section{Modeling speakers' choice of referring expression}
\label{sec:models}

\red{introduce the basic model and show why it doesn't get overinformative}

\subsection{Extending the basic model with noisy truth functions}
\label{sec:noisytruthmodel}

\red{show the model extension and the predictions it makes for the basic color/size asymmetry. report our replication of gatt?}

\subsection{Number of distractors}
\label{sec:numdistmodel}

The extended noisy semantics model makes a number of novel predictions for the rate of redundant adjective use. In particular, we can ask what the predicted rate of redundant adjective use is as a function of a) the number of distractor items and b) the features of those distractor objects. It has been shown in the past that overmodification increases with the number of distractors that are present \cite{bla}. It has also been established that there is more overmodification in polychrome rather than monochrome displays \cite{bla -- see paula's paper} and in scenes in which objects differ along more feature dimensions \cite{koolen bla}. \red{or save the scene variation stuff for the next section?}

The noisy semantics model's predictions are shown in \figref{fig:numdistractors}. \red{spell out the different conditions and why they're interesting -- why not just number of distractors, why TYPE as well?}

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:numdistractors}
\end{figure}

To test the model's predictions, we conducted two interactive web-based written production studies within a reference game setting.\footnote{See \appref{app:replication}  for a validation of the general paradigm, in which we qualitatively replicate the findings of \citeA{gatt2011} with a different set of stimuli.} Speakers and listeners were shown arrays of objects of that could vary in color and size. Speakers were to produce a referring expression to allow the listener to identify a target object. We manipulated the number of distractor objects in the grid, as well as the variation in color and size among distractor objects.

\subsubsection{Method}

\paragraph{Participants}

We recruited 60 pairs of participants (120 participants total) over Amazon's Mechanical Turk who were each paid \$1.75 for their participation. Here and in all other experiments reported in this paper, participants’ IP address was limited to US addresses only and only participants with a past work approval rate of at least 95\% were accepted. The data of five pairs were excluded from analysis because one of the participants dropped out before completing the experiment.

\paragraph{Procedure}

Participants were paired up via \red{is there something in robert's tools to cite?}. For each pair, one participant was assigned the speaker role and one the listener role. They  initially received written instructions \red{more info}. Before continuing to the experiment, participants were required to correctly answer a series of questions about the experimental procedure. These questions are listed in \appref{app:numdistractors}.

On each trial participants saw an array of objects. The array contained the same objects for both speaker and listener, but the order of objects was randomized and was typically different for speaker and listener. In the speaker's display, one of the objects -- henceforth the \emph{target} -- was highlighted with a green border. See \figref{fig:exampledisplay} for an example of the listener's and speaker's view on a particular trial.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:exampledisplay}
\red{insert example display}
\end{figure}

The speaker produced a referring expression to communicate the target to the listener by typing in a chat window. After pressing Enter or clicking the `Send' button, the speaker's message was shown to the listener. The listener then clicked on the object they thought was the target, given the speaker's message.  Once the listener clicked an object, a red border appeared around that object in both the listener and the speaker's display for 1 second before advancing to the next trial.

Both speakers and listeners could write in the chat window, allowing listeners to request clarification if necessary. Listeners could only click on an object and advance to the next trial once the speaker had sent a message.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Materials}

Participants proceeded through 72 trials. Of these, half were critical trials of interest and half were filler trials. On critical trials, we varied the feature that was sufficient to mention for uniquely establishing reference, the total number of objects in the array, and  the number of objects that shared the non-sufficient feature with the target. 

Objects varied in color and size. On 18 trials, color was a sufficient property for distinguishing the target. On the other 18 trials, size was sufficient. See \figref{fig:speakerlistenerperspective} for an example of a size-sufficient trial from both the speaker's and the listener's perspective. 


In Exp.~1, the number of distractor objects in each array was either 2 (12 trials) or 4 (24 trials). In Exp.~2, the number of distractor objects in each array was either 2, 3, or 4. Finally, we varied the number of distractors that shared the non-sufficient property with the target. That is, when size was the sufficiently distinguishing property, we varied the number of distractors that shared the same color as the target. This number had to be at least one, since otherwise the non-sufficient property would have been sufficient for uniquely establishing reference, i.e.~it would not have been redundant to mention it. 

In Exp.~1, each total number of distractors (2, 4) was crossed with each possible number of distractors that shared the non-sufficient property, leading to the following six conditions: \emph{2-1, 2-2, 4-1, 4-2, 4-3,} and \emph{4-4}, where the first number indicates the total number and the second number the shared number of distractors. Exp.~2 was conducted in order to additionally collect data for the \emph{3-X} conditions. To this end, Exp.~2 included the \emph{3-1, 3-2}, and \emph{3-3} conditions, as well as three conditions repeated from Exp.~1, in order to ensure that results were comparable. The repeated conditions were \emph{2-1, 4-1}, and \emph{4-3}. An overview of the number of trials in each condition and experiment is provided in \tableref{tab:conditions}.

\begin{table}

	\midrule
	3 & 1 & 6 & 2\\

	\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\label{tab:conditions}	
\end{table}

Fillers were target trials from a different experiment \cite{graf-underreview}. Each filler item contained a three-object grid. None of the filler objects occurred on target trials. Objects stood in various taxonomic relations to each other and required neither size nor color mention for unique reference. For example, a filler trial could consist of a display with a dalmatian, a pug, and a squirrel.
